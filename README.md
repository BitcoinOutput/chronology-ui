# Chronology UI

Chronology UI is a UI code generation tool for the [`chronology`](https://github.com/OthersideAI/chronology) pip package. The goal of this project is to make it easy for people to build together long GPT-3 prompt chains, without needing to delve too deeply into the code base.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The most up to date version of the project is hosted [here](https://chronology-ui.vercel.app/#).
